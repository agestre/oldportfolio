    <p>This is a side-scroller game my partner Alana and I created using Scratch! In the game, you help a hungry bear named Bubsy collect honey by navigating through the holes in the honeycombs. Click on the picture to play! </p>
   <h2>Obamicon</h2>

   <p>This project takes a photo (that's a jpeg file) that you input and applies a filter that is similar to the one Obama used during his campaign. We coded this in Python. I created this with my partners Abi and Caity. At first, we were stumped on what to do. When it worked, we were still confused on interpreting our code. But after reviewing and improving it, we came to understand it fully and became super proud of this!</p>
