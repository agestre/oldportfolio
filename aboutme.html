	<h3>Biography</h3>
  <p> Hi! I'm Angelica. I'm 15 years old and a rising junior from the east bay of California. I love music, whether I'm playing (my guitar, ukelele, or piano), singing, or listening to it. I also love reading. <br/>I've been spending my summer 2k17 in Palo Alto learning how to code thanks to Girls Who Code. I've been loving it so far, and I'm super excited to learn more! </p>
