	<h2>biography</h2>
  <p> Hey there! I'm Angelica. I'm 15 years old and a rising junior in high school. I'm from the east bay of California. I love music, whether I'm singing, playing an instrument (my guitar, ukelele, or piano), or listening to it. I also love to read and pet all the pups I see. <br/><br/>I've been spending my summer '17 in Palo Alto learning how to code thanks to Girls Who Code. I've been loving it so far, and I'm super excited to learn more! </p>

     <h3>projects</h3>
      <h4>Reach the Honey</h4>
     <p>
  <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/166992650/">
  <img src="http://i1259.photobucket.com/albums/ii557/angvlica/Screen%20Shot%202017-06-26%20at%2012.17.03%20PM_zpsl1ojlr4y.png" alt="Play 'Reach the Honey!'" width="400" height="275"   border="0">
  </a>
  </p>
  
    <p>This is a side-scroller game my partner Alana and I created using Scratch! In the game, you help a hungry bear named Bubsy collect honey by navigating through the holes in the honeycombs. Click on the picture to play! </p>
   <h4>Obamicon</h4>
   
   <img src="http://i1259.photobucket.com/albums/ii557/angvlica/tree_zpsinuuia7y.jpg" style="width:50%"> <!---alt="'Mickey Mouse before and after using 'Obamicon'!"---> 
   
   <p>This project takes a photo (that's a jpeg file) that you input and applies a filter that is similar to the one Obama used during his campaign. We coded this in Python. I created this with my partners Abi and Caity. At first, we were stumped on what to do. When it worked, we were still confused on interpreting our code. But after reviewing and improving it, we came to understand it fully and became super proud of this!</p>
